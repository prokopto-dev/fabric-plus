============
``transfer``
============

The ``TransferPlus`` class is a subclass of the ``Transfer`` class from the
``fabric`` library.

As such, the behavior is (almost) identical to the ``Transfer`` class from Fabric.

To see those behaviors, please refer to the `Fabric documentation <https://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/api/transfer.html>`_.
